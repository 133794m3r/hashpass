       Awesome Password Generator
    </h1>
    <p style='width:95%'>
        This site will hash your password with scrypt, the username, the site's name and your password for salt(to make it harder to guess). It will generate by default a14 character
        psuedo-random password that will always be the same for the same inputs(what you entered), changing one letter in any
        of the boxes will change everything. Thus the entire thing is case sensitive. You can change the length by changing the "Output Length" option
        to make it the length of the password the maximum that you require. You can also disable special character that is added onto the end if the site that you're using doesn't allow it(only way to know is to try pasting the password into teh site. If it doesn't work and says the password isn't allowed then check the box, and click generate password again and it'll give you a new password that doesn't have the special character on the end. Please note that the maximum length that it can generate is around 53-55 characters. 
<br /><p><b>If the score for the original password is below 2 it is considered weak below 1 is extremely weak.You want the original score to be <i>at least 1</i>
        Try to add a few numbers, also try not to use your username or the sitename in the password. Suchas a facebook password being facebookpassword. You entered facebook as site name and then entered that password as your password is will be weaker as people are going to likely try to use your username/sitename you entered when trying to guess the password. The tool will also help you with this by providing some feedback too. <br />We use <a href='https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn/blob/master/README.md'>ZXCVBN</a> to guess the strengths of the passwords. It has been shown to be extremely accurate for guessing how long it would take for a hacker to guess a password.</b></p>

    The score is from 0 through 4, with a higher score meaning a more secure password. A score of 3 or higher is what's considered safe for your password not being cracked in an attack.
    If it's below 3 it means that if a site is hacked and their passwords are stolen you can assume your password won't really be safe.</span>
