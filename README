Overall this is considered at least version 1.0 as everything works and strength is high enough to make it extremely costly to guess a password that was used for generating the password from this system.

The scrypt js library minified in scrypt1.js is licensed under the MIT from the original source. I have included their link in the source file itself. It is no longer async but is now synchronous those looking for an async version should look at the source repo.
