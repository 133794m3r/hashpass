This is a simple password hasher using bcrypt+sha1, it also has a bookmarklet
which allows you to use it the same as you would if it was supergenpass
unlike super gen pass, we are using a stronger algorithm with much stronger
security for your generated passwords if anyone ever manages to get the 
password(s) and knows you use this software.
