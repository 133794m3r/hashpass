This is a simple password hasher using scrypt,which allows you to use it the same as you would if it was supergenpass unlike super gen pass, we are using a stronger algorithm with much stronger

Overall this is considered at least version 1.0 as everything works and strength is high enough to make it extremely costly to guess a password that was used for generating the password from this system.

I also have included ZXCVBN for password strength estimation. It is licensed as MIT-like it looks like.
